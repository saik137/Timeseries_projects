# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM for Electricity Consumption

This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict electricity consumption. The goal is to leverage historical electricity consumption data to build a model that can accurately forecast future electricity demand.

## Introduction

Electricity consumption forecasting plays a crucial role in various domains such as energy management, load balancing, and resource planning. By accurately predicting electricity demand, utility companies, governments, and other stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding capacity planning, pricing, and sustainable energy utilization.

This project utilizes the power of LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. LSTM models are particularly effective for capturing patterns, trends, and seasonal variations in electricity consumption data, making them well-suited for accurate forecasting.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and feature engineering techniques specific to time series data.
- LSTM Modeling: Building and training LSTM models to learn the patterns and relationships within the electricity consumption time series.
- Evaluation and Validation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
- Forecasting: Generating future electricity consumption predictions based on trained LSTM models.
- Visualization: Creating informative visualizations, such as time series plots, prediction vs. actual comparisons, and trend analysis.

## Dataset

The project will utilize a publicly available electricity consumption dataset, which includes historical records of electricity usage at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, or monthly). The dataset may include additional features such as weather conditions, holidays, or other relevant factors that can influence electricity consumption.

## Implementation

The project will be implemented primarily in Python, leveraging popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas. Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts will be provided to demonstrate the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
